Database Management Systems (DBMS) were developed to address the following issues in traditional file-processing systems:
1. **Data Redundancy and Inconsistency**
2. **Difficulty in Accessing Data**
3. **Data Isolation** â€“ multiple files and formats
4. **Integrity Problems**
5. **Atomicity of Updates**
6. **Concurrent Access by Multiple Users**
7. **Security Problems**

## 2. What are super, primary, candidate, and foreign keys?
- **Super Key**: A set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple in a relation.
- **Candidate Key**: A minimal superkey, no proper subset of which can be a superkey.
- **Primary Key**: A selected candidate key used to uniquely identify records in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.

## 3. What is the difference between primary key and unique constraints?
- **Primary Key**: Cannot have NULL values and there is only one primary key per table.
- **Unique Constraints**: Can have NULL values and there can be multiple unique constraints per table.

## 4. What is database normalization?
Database normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing tables to eliminate undesirable anomalies like insertion, deletion, and update anomalies.

## 5. Why is the use of DBMS recommended? Explain by listing some of its major advantages.
- **Controlled Redundancy**: Minimizes data duplication.
- **Data Sharing**: Multiple users can access data simultaneously.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Automates data backup and recovery.

```sql
SELECT StudentCourse.CourseID, Student.StudentName
FROM StudentCourse
INNER JOIN Student ON StudentCourse.EnrollNo = Student.EnrollNo
ORDER BY StudentCourse.CourseID;
```

## 10. What is Identity?
Identity (or AutoNumber) is a column that automatically generates unique numeric values for new records.

QBE is a visual approach for accessing information in a database by using query templates, allowing users to create queries by entering example values.

## 23. Why are cursors necessary in embedded SQL?
Cursors allow row-by-row processing of query results in embedded SQL, which operates on sets of data.

## 24. What is the purpose of normalization in DBMS?
Normalization reduces redundancy and database anomalies, divides large tables into smaller ones, and maintains data integrity.

## 25. What is the difference between a database schema and a database state?
- **Database Schema**: Overall design of the database.
- **Database State**: Collection of information stored in a database at a particular moment.

## 26. Explain the concepts of a Primary key and Foreign Key.
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies records in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: Links two tables together, referencing the primary key of another table.

## 27. What are the main differences between Primary key and Unique Key?
- **Primary Key**: Cannot have NULL values; only one per table.
- **Unique Key**: Can have NULL values; multiple allowed per table.

## 28. What is the concept of sub-query in SQL?
A sub-query is a query within another query, used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query.

## 29. What is the use of the DROP command and what are the differences between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE commands?

First Normal Form (1NF) requires each table cell to contain only atomic (indivisible) values.

## 38. What is 2NF in DBMS?
Second Normal Form (2NF) is achieved when a table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.

## 39. What is 3NF in DBMS?
Third Normal Form (3NF) is achieved when a table is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are not transitively dependent on the primary key.

## 40. What is BCNF in DBMS?
Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is a stricter version of 3NF, ensuring that for every functional dependency X->Y, X is a superkey.

Conceptual design is the first stage in database design, focusing on the high-level structure and relationships of data.

## 51. Differentiate between logical database design and physical database design. How does this separation lead to data independence?
- **Logical Database Design**: Focuses on the abstract structure of the database.
- **Physical Database Design**: Focuses on the actual storage of data.
This separation leads to data independence by allowing changes in physical storage without affecting logical structure.

## 52. What are temporary tables? When are they useful?
